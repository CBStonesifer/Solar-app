## The Social Social Media App
#### Emphasizing Social over Media

Today, a lot of the connections we think we maintain over social media have become fake and impersonal. We consume media shared by our friends creating a false sense of being current in their lives. Checking who viewed your posts and liking others' does not nearly foster the same connection received from a text as brief as "Hey, how are you?". Furthermore, the frequency at which we receive media from certain individuals over others can skew how relevant they actually are in our lives.

##### The goal of Solar is to use the solar system as a visual analogy to organize your relationships and help sustain real connections with those who matter.

The two key features of the app are the relationship visualizations and sustaining real connections.

See the Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/SmRKtGoQdmShqBVCOHJbxK/Solar?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=r6Q3zx4NwkYRM9Kh-1

#### Visualization
The analogy goes like this:
The main page has a UI that is a zoomable helio-centric model of the solar system -- but with you as the star in the center of your solar system (social circle).

The people we speak with the most, our best friends, our inner circle, are going to orbit the closest to us.

The next orbits include our close friends, then good friends, and friends. It's probably important these aren't given strict definitions, they are not rankings, this is not a tier list, but hopefully an honest reflection of how strong our bonds are with the people we care about -> and a chance to strengthen them.

Now we get to the asteroid belt: people we are getting to know, or relationships left unattended for too long, that we can give the chance to gravitate towards us. These can be people we might see often but haven't formed a bond with.\
Beyond that outer orbits can include work friends, acquaintances, or people you know well despite a lack of endearment for them (like an annoying cousin).
People can be comets as well, close friends in distant places that circle close but spend most of their time in other parts of the galaxy.

Given many orbits will have many people circling on the same level, tags can cluster them together to also help organize friend groups.
Mutual friends can orbit the people we have in common as moons, you may not see them on their own and only when with your friend in common.

Data about who is input into your solar system is not available to other users. There should not be a game of chicken with each added user to guess where they have put you in their solar system and a need to guess where to place them, only data that is intended to be public will be available to those in your solar system.


#### Real Connections
Real connections are formed when we personally reach out to those we know, follow up with them, have conversations, find common interests, and engage. Visualizing our relationships is only the beginning of how we can determine who in our circles needs our attention.

To do this, Solar will propose friends in your solar system to reach out to based on the time elapsed since you last interacted. Anywhere between a 30-minute Facetime monthly or a 3-word text annually could be enough to demonstrate genuine care for someone. Resistance when reaching out can build when a relationship is left unattended for too long, even for your comets.

Better yet, would it not be convenient to have a plethora of excuses to reach out to your friends? Users are encouraged to share their interests and other personal information with their network. Query the people in your network who play golf and schedule a tee time. Find out who else is a fan of Neil deGrasse Tyson and share with them your favorite of his interviews. See if any of your comets are visiting your city soon.

It is far more effective to broadcast to your network that you are visiting San Fransisco than allude to it on an Instagram story most people won't see, and even fewer respond to.


This is how social media like Facebook started, but they have divulged too far from this original purpose. Just being friends online isn't enough and we are distracted by the media.

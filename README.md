## The Social Social Media App
#### Emphasizing Social over Media

Today, a lot of the connections we think we maintain over social media have become fake and impersonal. We consume media shared by our friends creating a false sense of being current on their lives. Checking who viewed your posts and liking others' does not nearly foster the same connection received from a text as brief as "Hey, how are you?". Furthermore, the frequency at which we receive media from certain individuals over others can skew how relevant they actually are in our lives.

##### The goal of Solar is to use the solar system as a visual analogy to organize your relationships and help sustain real connections with those who matter.
